2022-06-03 | HydraPak Ultraflask collapsible water bottle   | 10 | Empty it to go through security and refill the other side.
2022-08-13 | Chargers always in hand luggage                |  9 | Usually somewhere to plug in on trains these days, worth keeping to hand.
2022-06-03 | OLight OPen                                    |  6 | Great torch + pen, no sharp edges, ok to take through security.
2022-09-05 | "Adventure before Dementia" patch              |  4 | If we really do a "lads trip" next year I might buy some of these.

2022-07-05 | Micro razor                                    |  4 | I like the micro razor, but is just taking one disposable blade and using hotel soap better?
2022-09-05 | More socks than expected (crazy talk)          |  0 | Seen this idea, but I don't take socks for every day, try to wear flip flops...
2022-09-05 | Fjallraven trekking trousers. Too hot.         |  0 | I love them, but they're too hot for hot weather even with the vents.
